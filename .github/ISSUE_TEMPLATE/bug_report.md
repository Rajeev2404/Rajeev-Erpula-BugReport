**Describe the bug**
The bug occurs within the Instagram mobile application, where notifications are displayed upon opening the app. However, upon tapping on these notifications, users are directed to view the content associated with the notification, only to find that there is no content available to be displayed. Despite notifications appearing to indicate recent activities or interactions within the app, such as likes, comments, or messages, users are unable to access the corresponding content, leading to a frustrating and confusing user experience.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1.Open the Instagram mobile application.
2.Observe notifications appearing on the screen.
3.Tap on the notifications to view their content.
4.Notice that there is no content displayed despite the notifications being present

**Expected behavior**
When I open the Instagram mobile application, I expect the notifications to show recent activities or interactions within the app accurately. For example, if someone liked my post or sent me a direct message, I anticipate seeing notifications for these actions. Furthermore, when I tap on a notification, I expect to be taken directly to the corresponding content, such as the liked post or the received message. In essence, the expected behavior is for notifications to provide me with actionable information about recent activities on my Instagram account, enhancing my overall user experience.

**Screenshots**
If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.
